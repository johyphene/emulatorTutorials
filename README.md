These files were featured at the 2025 IMSI Uncertainty Quantification Strategies for Multi-Physics Systems and Digital Twins Workshop Tutorial session.
To run these files, download everything from either the R or MATLAB folder.
You will need to change the filepaths in R to match where you saved the files.
You will also need to install any packages you do not already have.
For MATLAB, you will need to run the compile_cpp() command once on your machine after adding the functions filepath.
You amy also need to download some sort of C++ compiler and the Optimization Toolbox on MATLAB, if you do not already have them.
